# Pneumonia_Image_Classification
Pneumonia Image Classification: Deep Learning and ML Fusion
This is the code whcih uses deep learning models like ResNet50, VIT and inception_v3 as feature extraction models and utilizing machine learning algorithm to classify the chest X-ray (CXR) images to detect whether the patients caught a pneumonia.
What's more, we also provide a funny codes called "compare_figure_similarity.ipynb". It can find the figure that is most similar to the figure you given in the set of images you given.
